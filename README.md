# Attestation
## Why Attestation?
Attestation allows developers to increase user conversion by placing users directly into an app instead of landing pages. While landing pages sometimes work well, users love getting their hands dirty, however getting a user to properly create an account when they have 0 experience with the app is difficult. Attestation plans to change this by giving each "user" a secure token that will be stored in the browser.

You may be thinking: "my current authentication system allows for token authorization, so why can't I just use that?" The difference between Attestation and other libraries is that Attestation does all of the heavy lifting for you. If it detects a new user, it'll automatically spin up their user account. 

## Why is it called Attestation?
At its core, Attestation was created for users who may normally not want to go through tedious authentication flows, especially when they simply want to try a product. Instead of handing over personal information like emails, names, and other fields right off the bat, users can try a product first, and if they like it, be able to easily attach sign up variables like an email and password.
